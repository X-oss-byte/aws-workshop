# Deploy Sample Application

## Our Application
We'll be using the [Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic) version of the [Spring PetClinic](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/) sample Java application. This is a sample application designed to show how the Spring stack can be used to build simple, but powerful database-oriented applications - and will allow us to demonstrate Lightrun's capabilities in the JVM world.

Please refer to (TODO: Add link) the "Getting Familiar with Our Sample Application" section to learn more about Spring PetClinic.
