## Welcome

Lighrunâ€™s Developer Observability Platform allows backend developers, DevOps engineers and SREs to add dynamic logs, snapshots and metrics to live applications - in real time and on-demand. 

By breathing new life into the time-old practice of printf debugging, Lightrun's safe, dynamic instrumentation allows practitioners to quickly and easily troubleshoot issues in production, CI and pre-prod environments, perform code flow investigation, optimize observability costs, analyze and fix performance bottlenecks and much, much more.

In this workshop you'll learn how to use Lightrun with a real-life, AWS-hosted application, and explore how dynamic instrumentation can change your development and troubleshooting experience.
