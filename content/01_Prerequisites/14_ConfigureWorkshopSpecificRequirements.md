# Configuring Workshop Specific Requirements

This workshop a couple of Lightrun's major features - Lightrun Logs Snapshots and Lightrun Snapshots.

The former can be consumed from both the Lightrun IDE console and external integrations. We will focus on "piping" - i.e. transmitting - Lightrun information into AWS services, most notably AWS CloudWatch.

AWS CloudWatch does not require any additional configuration at this time, and we will be discussing how to do said "piping" in a future module.
