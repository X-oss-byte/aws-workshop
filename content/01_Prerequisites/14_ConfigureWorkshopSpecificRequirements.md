# Configuring Workshop Specific Requirements

This workshop a few of Lightrun's major features - Lightrun Snapshots, Lightrun Logs and Lightrun Metrics.

The latter two can be consumed from both the Lightrun IDE console and external integrations. We will focus on "piping" - i.e. transmitting - Lightrun information into AWS services, most notably AWS CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Grafana and Amazon Managed Prometheus.

Neither AWS CloudWatch or Amazon Managed Grafana require any additional configuration at this time.
However, there is additional configuration required to get started with Prometheus and Lightrun.
